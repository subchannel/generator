## Usage

First install Yeoman and the Subchannel generator globally using [npm](https://npmjs.org).

```
$ npm install --global yo generator-subchannel
```

Then create a new project directory and run the generator inside of it.

```
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ yo subchannel
```

The default Subchannel generator will create generic files that should be included in any project such as `.gitignore`, `README.md` and a few others.
